## Building (and Connecting to WiFi)
Copy the file `wifi_login.h.example` to `wifi_login.h`. Then edit it and change these lines, leaving the "quote marks" intact:
```wifi_login.h
#define WIFI_SSID "your ssid"
...
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "enter your wifi password here"
```

Build using the Arduino IDE or compatible IDE such as VS Code. After uploading the sketch, when the Blueprint powers on, it will show "Connecting to your_ssid..." on the screen. Ensure this matches the ssid that you set. While the Blueprint is connected to wifi, there will be a small antenna symbol in the upper right corner of the screen.

## Supported Transit Networks

This project supports the following transit networks:
* Translink (Vancouver, BC)
* TriMet (Portland, OR)

To switch between networks, you need to modify `arduino_busstop.ino` to include the correct network module, and `network_config.h` to set the correct stop and route numbers.

For example, to use the Translink network, you would include `translink/translink.h` in `arduino_busstop.ino`:
```c++
#include "translink/translink.h"
```

To use the TriMet network, you would include `trimet/trimet.h` in `arduino_busstop.ino`:
```c++
#include "trimet/trimet.h"
```

Then, you need to edit `network_config.h` to set the desired stop and route numbers.

**Note:** The TriMet module uses a placeholder certificate. You will need to replace it with the correct certificate for the TriMet API. You will also need to add your own TriMet APP ID to the url in `trimet/trimet.cpp`.
