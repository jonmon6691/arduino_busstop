## Building (and Connecting to WiFi)
Copy the file `wifi_login.h.example` to `wifi_login.h`. Then edit it and change these lines, leaving the "quote marks" intact:
```wifi_login.h
#define WIFI_SSID "your ssid"
...
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "enter your wifi password here"
```

Build using the Arduino IDE or compatible IDE such as VS Code. After uploading the sketch, when the Blueprint powers on, it will show "Connecting to your_ssid..." on the screen. Ensure this matches the ssid that you set. While the Blueprint is connected to wifi, there will be a small antenna symbol in the upper right corner of the screen.
