## Building (and Connecting to WiFi)
Copy the file `wifi_login.h.example` to `wifi_login.h`. Then edit it and change these lines, leaving the "quote marks" intact:
```wifi_login.h
#define WIFI_SSID "your ssid"
...
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "enter your wifi password here"
```

Build using the Arduino IDE or compatible IDE such as VS Code. After uploading the sketch, when the Blueprint powers on, it will show "Connecting to your_ssid..." on the screen. Ensure this matches the ssid that you set. While the Blueprint is connected to wifi, there will be a small antenna symbol in the upper right corner of the screen.

## Configuring the stops

This project supports the following transit networks:
* Translink (Vancouver, BC)
* TriMet (Portland, OR) (Untested)

To switch between networks, you need to modify `arduino_busstop.ino` to include the correct network module, and `busstop_config.h` to set the correct stop and route numbers.

For example, to use the Translink network, you would include `translink.h` in `arduino_busstop.ino`:
```c++
#include "translink.h"
```

To use the TriMet network, you would include `trimet.h` in `arduino_busstop.ino`:
```c++
#include "trimet.h"
```

Then, you need to edit `busstop_config.h` to set the desired stop and route numbers.
